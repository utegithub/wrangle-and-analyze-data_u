The following data was used

A Twitter archive provided by WeRateDogs

An image prediction file, containing predictions for the dog breed based on the image

Data for retweet and favorite counts from the Twitter API


Intention
Your goal: wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. The Twitter archive is great, but it only contains very basic tweet information. Additional gathering, then assessing and cleaning is required for "Wow!"-worthy analyses and visualizations.
